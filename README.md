Q: What is recursion?    :   
A: a function that calls it self


Q: what is recursion used for?    :   
A: 

Q: what is recursion most useful for?  :   
A: for task that have repeated sub-task to do

Q: an example of recursion?    :   
A: 
    
     function call(){    
          call();   
     }   // will cause stackoverflow 

Q: what type of algorithms is recursion used in ?  :   
A: 


Q: what is a base case?    :   
A: A recursive function terminates, if with every recursive call the  solution of the problem is downsized and moves towards a base case. A base case is a case, where the problem can be solved without further recursion.

Q: What is stack overflow?     :   
A: a stack grabs a piece of memory from out computer to run a function or process, when a process demands too many stacks there is then a stack overflow - which is to say we've ran out of memory  

Q: how do we prevent stack overflow?    :   
A: providing an alg which implements recursive calls a base case

Q: what does a base case look like?    :   
A: usually an conditional check provided to the function - right before the recursive action
   
Q: what are the rules to keep in  mind when writing a recursive function?   :   

A: 
  1. Identify the base case
  2. Identify the recursive case   
  3. get closer and closer and return 
        // usually we have 2 returns in recursive algs
   
Statement: Anything you can do with a recursion Can  be done iteratively ( loop )

Q: benefits of using recursion over iteration :   
A:
